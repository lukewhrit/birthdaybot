# birthdaybot

Basic Discord bot that gives users a role whenever it's their birthday. Only functions in one server per bot instance and stores data in a SQLite database. Additionally, this bot uses slash commands and therefore requires server permissions to do so.

Eventually I'll probably write a more advanced version of this bot, that supports more database and has a tidier codebase.
